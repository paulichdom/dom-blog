Before delving into combining multiple types in TypeScript, it's important to
understand the fundamentals of Type Aliases and Interfaces and their workings.
TypeScript allows types to be defined separately from the variables that use them.
Aliases and Interfaces allows types to be easily shared between different variables/objects.

## Type Aliases

One of the features that make TypeScript so useful is the ability to create type aliases.
Type aliases allow you to create custom types that can be used throughout your code.
A new custom type is defined with a custom name (an Alias). Alias can be used for primitives
like string or more complex types such as `objects` and `arrays`.

<br />
Think of Types like variables: Much like how you can create variables with the same
name in different scopes, a type has similar semantics.
<br />
Let's look at some basic examples:

```ts
// Primitive type
// Useful for documentation mainly

type SanitasedInput = string;
type MissingNo = 404;

// Object literal type

type Location = {
  x: number;
  y;
  number;
};

// Tuple type
// A tuple is a specail-cased array with known types at specific indexes

type Data = [location: Location, timestamp: string];

// Union type
// Describes a type which is one of many options,
// for example a list of known strings

type Size = 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';

// Object Literal Syntax

type JSONResponse = {
  version: number; // Field
  //** In bytes */                         // Attached docs
  payloadSize: number;
  outOfStock?: boolean; // Optional
  update: (retrytTimes: number) => void; // Arrow func field
  update(retrytTimes: number): void; // Function
  (): JSONResponse; // Type is callable
  [key: string]: number; // Accepts any index
  new (s: string): JSONResponse; // Newable
  readonly body: string; // Readonly property
};
```

<br />
TypeScript offers several ways to define types, including basic types such as strings
and numbers, object types that define the shape of an object and its properties,
tuple types for arrays with a fixed length and specific types, union types that can
be one of several possibilities, and more advanced object literal syntax for more
detailed object type definitions, such as functions, callable types, and readonly
properties. Using these types can help make code more maintainable, predictable,
and less error-prone.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are similar to type aliases, except they **only** apply to object types.
An interface declaration is another way to name an object type.

<br />
Key points:
<br />
* Used to describe the shape of objects, and can be extendend by others. 
* Almost everything in JavaScript is an object and *interface* is built to match thier
runtime behavior.

```ts
// Common syntax

/**
 * Optionally take properties from existing interface type (HTTPAble)
 */
interface JSONResponse extends Response, HTTPAble {
  version: number;
  //** In bytes */                         // JSDoc comment attached to show in editors
  payloadSize: number;
  outOfStock?: boolean; // This property might not be on the object
  update: (retrytTimes: number) => void; // These are two ways to describe a property which is a function
  update(retrytTimes: number): void;
  (): JSONResponse; // You can call this object via () - (functions in JS are objects which can be called)
  [key: string]: number; // Any property not described already is assumed to exist, and all properties must be numbers
  new (s: string): JSONResponse; // You can use new on the object this interface describes
  readonly body: string; // Tells TypeScript that a property can not be changed
}
```

TypeScript interface is a way to describe the shape of an object type. It's similar to type aliases but only applies to object types.
Interfaces can extend other interfaces, and they allow optional properties, readonly properties, and index signatures.
An interface can also describe callable and constructable objects. Interfaces are useful for defining contracts between
different parts of a codebase or with external dependencies. They help catch errors early and make the code more maintainable.
Since TypeScript is a statically typed language, interfaces enable developers to define the structure of their code more explicitly,
which can make it easier to understand and work with in larger codebases.

## Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose between them freely.
Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot
be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

<br />
### Type vs Interface
<br />
* Interfaces can only describe object shapes 
* Interfaces can be extended bt declaring
it multiple times
* In performace critical types interface comparison checks
can be faster
<br />

**Extending** an interface means you are creating a new interface with the same properties as the original,
plus something new.

```ts
// Extending an interface

interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
```

#### Extension via merging:

<br />
Interfaces are merged, so multiple declarstions will add new fileds to the type definition.

```ts
interface APICall {
  data: Response;
}

interface APICall {
  error?: Error;
}
```
#### Intersection types
<br/>
A way to merge/extend types

```ts
type Animal = {
  name: string;
}

type Bear = Animal & {
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;

```

#### A type cannot be changed after being created

```ts
type Window = {
  title: string;
}

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

// Error; Ducplicate indentifier 'Window'.

```
