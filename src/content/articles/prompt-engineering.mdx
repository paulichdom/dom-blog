## Introduction

So in the
development of large language models or LLMs, there
have been broadly two types of LLMs Which
I'm going to refer to as:
<br/>
* base LLMs and 
* instruction tuned LLMs 
<br/>
So base OMS has been trained to predict the next
word based on text training data Often trained
on a large amount of data from the
internet and other sources To figure out what's
the next most likely word to follow So for example,
if you were to prompt this once upon a time there
was a unicorn It may complete this, that
is it may predict the next several words are That live in a magical
forest with all unicorn friends
<br />
But if you were to prompt this with what is the capital
of France Then based on what articles on
the internet might have It's quite possible that a
base LLMs will complete this with What is France's largest
city, what is France's population and so on Because articles on the
internet could quite plausibly be lists
of quiz questions about the country of France
<br />
In contrast, an instruction tuned LLMs,
which is where a lot of momentum of LLMs research and practice
has been going An instruction tuned LLMs has
been trained to follow instructions So if you
were to ask it, what is the capital of France is much more
likely to output something like the capital of France is Paris So
the way that instruction tuned LLMs are typically trained is You start
off with a base LLMs that's been trained on a huge amount
of text data And further train it for the fine tune it
with inputs and outputs that are instructions and good
attempts to follow those instructions And
then often further refine using a technique called RLHF
reinforcement learning from human feedback To make the system
better able to be helpful and follow instructions
