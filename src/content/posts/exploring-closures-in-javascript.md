Closures are an important concept in JavaScript that allow for powerful and flexible programming techniques. A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and it retains access to the parent function's variables even after the parent function has finished executing. In this article, we will explore what closures are and provide some examples to help illustrate how they work in JavaScript. By understanding how closures work, you can take advantage of them to create private variables, implement callbacks and event handlers, and more.

## What is a Closure?

A closure is a function that has access to the variables and scope of its parent function, even after the parent function has completed execution. Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function, and the inner function references a variable from the outer function. This allows the inner function to "close over" the variable and retain access to it, even if the outer function has completed execution and its variables are no longer in scope.

## Examples of Closures in JavaScript

To help understand closures, let's look at a few examples of how they can be used in JavaScript.
