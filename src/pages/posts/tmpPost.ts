  excerpt:
    'Engaging in regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week can significantly lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke, according to a 10-year study of over 10,000 participants. The type of exercise did not matter as much as the frequency and duration, suggesting even light or moderate exercise can have significant health benefits.',
